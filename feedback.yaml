two new rooms:
  maxpoints: 10
  points: 10
  feedback: good implementation
new ending:
  maxpoints: 20
  points: 19
  feedback: Great multi-stage implementation. Code may be cleaner if actions are defined more programmatically when the action results in new Items. This would help move code out of the Game class and make game code logic more readable.
locked door:
  maxpoints: 15
  points: 15
  feedback: multi key is great
item subclasses:
  maxpoints: 30
  points: 28
  feedback: good implementations, could use abstract class to minimize casting for max points
new item subclass:
  maxpoints: 15
  points: 13
  feedback: good basic implementation, same note about abstract class modifier
tests:
  maxpoints: 10
  points: 8
  feedback: good implementation, would be better to see tests involving GameState or other non-Item classes
EC:
  maxpoints: 15
  points: 5
  feedback: great practical bug fixes to majorly improve UI
