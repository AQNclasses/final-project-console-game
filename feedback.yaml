two new rooms:
  maxpoints: 10
  points: 9
  feedback: excellent. Deducting one point because I got stuck in the Office.
new ending:
  maxpoints: 20
  points: 20
  feedback: nice two-phase ending
locked door:
  maxpoints: 15
  points: 13
  feedback: good clean implementation, could type locked state as boolean instead of string. got stuck a few times in rooms where i could not progress.
item subclasses:
  maxpoints: 30
  points: 30
  feedback: all item subclasses implemented or replaced and implemented. nice job using abstract class.
new item subclass:
  maxpoints: 15
  points: 15
  feedback: container is interesting, I can think of other subclasses or possible unification with rooms and the locked feature
tests:
  maxpoints: 10
  points: 10
  feedback: good, tests both use gamestate and independently test class attributes
EC:
  maxpoints: 15
